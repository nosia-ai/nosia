## Quickstart

### One command installation

#### On a macOS, Debian or Ubuntu machine

It will install Docker, Ollama, and Nosia on a macOS, Debian or Ubuntu machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosia-ai/nosia-install/main/nosia-install.sh | sh
```

You should see the following output:

```
[x] Setting up environment
[x] Setting up Docker
[x] Setting up Ollama
[x] Starting Ollama
[x] Starting Nosia
```

You can now access Nosia at `https://nosia.localhost`

### Custom installation

#### With a remote Ollama

By default, Nosia sets up `ollama` locally.

To use a remote Ollama instance, set the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` environment variable during configuration.

**Example:**

Replace `$OLLAMA_HOST_IP` with the FQDN or IP address of your Ollama host and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosia-ai/nosia-install/main/nosia-install.sh \
  | OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://$OLLAMA_HOST_IP:11434 sh
```

#### With a custom completion model

By default, Nosia uses:

1. Completion model: `qwen2.5`
1. Embeddings model: `nomic-embed-text`
1. Checking model: `bespoke-minicheck`

You can use any completion model available on Ollama by setting the `LLM_MODEL` environment variable during the installation.

**Example:**

To use the `mistral` model, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosia-ai/nosia-install/main/nosia-install.sh \
  | LLM_MODEL=mistral sh
```

#### With a custom embeddings model

At this time, the `nomic-embed-text` embeddings model is required for Nosia to work.

### Advanced installation

### On a macOS with a Debian or Ubuntu VM

On macOS, install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then install Ollama with Homebrew:

Replace `$OLLAMA_HOST_IP` with the IP address of the Ollama host machine and run the following command:

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama pull qwen2.5
ollama pull bespoke-minicheck
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=$OLLAMA_HOST_IP:11434 OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=3 ollama serve
```

On the Debian/Ubuntu VM:

Replace `$OLLAMA_HOST_IP` with the IP address of the host machine and run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosia-ai/nosia-install/main/nosia-install.sh \
  | OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://$OLLAMA_HOST_IP:11434 sh
```

You should see the following output:

```
[x] Setting up environment
[x] Setting up Docker
[x] Setting up Ollama
[x] Starting Ollama
[x] Starting Nosia
```

From the VM, you can access Nosia at `https://nosia.localhost`

If you want to access Nosia from the host machine, you may need to forward the port from the VM to the host machine.

Replace `$USER` with the username of the VM, `$VM_IP` with the IP address of the VM, and `$LOCAL_PORT` with the port you want to use on the host machine, 8443 for example, and run the following command:

```bash
ssh $USER@$VM_IP -L $LOCAL_PORT:localhost:443
```

After running the command, you can access Nosia at `https://nosia.localhost:$LOCAL_PORT`.

## API

## Get an API token

1. Go as a logged in user to `https://nosia.localhost/api_tokens`
1. Generate and copy your token
1. Use your favorite OpenAI chat completion API client by configuring API base to `https://nosia.localhost/v1` and API key with your token.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issue:

- during the installation, you can check the logs at `./log/production.log`
- during the use waiting for an AI response, you can check the jobs at `http://<IP>:3000/jobs`
- with Nosia, you can check the logs with `docker compose -f ./docker-compose.yml logs -f`
- with the Ollama server, you can check the logs at `~/.ollama/logs/server.log`
